# CoLab

## What is CoLab?
CoLab is a private directory that lets you find & collaborate with like minded artists & alumni. You're a poet who needs a sound artist for an upcoming class assignment? No problem. A grip looking to join a shoot, or an installation artists who graduated from SAIC wanting to collaborate with a sculptor from RISD? Yeah, we can help with all of that. Enter your deets and begin creeping on your peers from different art schools.

## What can I expect?
CoLab allows artists at one institution to search for and collaborate with artists at different universities based off their artistic practice, their past body of work, as well as their social media presence, so you can find the right fit both artistically, and personally.

## How can I get in?
CoLab is in Development  

CoLab begins with three – SAIC, Columbia, RISD – before connecting the nation's top art schools. What kind of artwork can be produced when the top academic and artistic minds are provided a framework to communicate and collaborate? That's what we want to find out.
